# Concrete-Strength-Prediction
In this Project, we are going to analyze the concrete compressive strength dataset and build a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength 

Tools and Technology Used: 
Jupyter Notebook(Anaconda 3), Numpy, Pandas, Sk-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Machine Learning Algorithm

Applied Techniques:
1) Import and read a dataset by using pandas 

2) Data Pre-Processing

3)Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

4)Splitting the train and test dataset by using Sk-Learn 

5)Model building

6)Evaluating the accuracy score

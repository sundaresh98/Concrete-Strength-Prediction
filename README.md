In this Project, we are going to analyze the concrete compressive strength dataset and build a machine learning model to predict the compressive strength 

Tools and Technology Used: 
Jupyter Notebook(Anaconda 3), Numpy, Pandas, Sk-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Machine Learning Algorithm

Applied Techniques:

Import and read a dataset by using pandas 

Data Pre-Processing

Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

Splitting the train and test dataset by using Sk-Learn 

Model building

Evaluating the accuracy score
